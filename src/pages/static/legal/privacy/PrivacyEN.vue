      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to {{

      }}’s online
        collaboration tools and platform, including the associated {{ settingsFile().appName }} mobile and desktop
        applications (collectively,

        (collectively, the

        Community, etc.) you may

        or

        Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with our Services
        (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”), or any other third-party products, services or businesses.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>You, the organization (e.g., your employer or another
        entity or person) controlling the use of the Services (“<strong>Organization</strong>”) and any associated
        Customer Content, and any individuals who are granted access to the Services by an Organization
        (“<strong>Users</strong>” and, collectively with you and an Organization, “<strong>Customer</strong>”) are
        also
        bound by the the <a :href="settingsFile().legal.URL.terms"><u>Terms of

      <p>If you have any questions about specific Organization

      <h3 id="2.-identifying-the-data-controller-and-processor"><strong>2.
          Identifying the Data Controller and Processor</strong></h3>
      <p>Data protection law in certain jurisdictions
        differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of Personal Data. Whether {{ settingsFile().appName }}
        or Customer is the
        controller or processor of Personal Data depends on the type of data used and the purposes for such use.</p>
      <p>Customer is the controller for all Customer Content
        that
        is also Personal Data. As the controller, Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove
        access
        to an Organization, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove information
        and otherwise apply its policies to the Services. As the processor for Customer Content, {{
          settingsFile().appName }} processes Customer
        Content that is Personal Data only on Customer’s request and in accordance with Customer’s written
        instructions,
        including the applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, Customer’s use of the Services, and as required by
        applicable law. For more information about how Customer Content is processed (such as how your Personal Data
        is
        processed, the purpose and legal basis for processing, and your data subject rights), we refer you to the
        relevant Customer’s privacy notice.</p>
      <p>{{ settingsFile().appName }} is the controller for
        Services Data as defined in
        Section 3.</p>
      <h3 id="3.-the-types-of-personal-data-we-collect"><strong>3. The types of
          Personal Data we collect</strong></h3>
      <p>Your Personal Data is provided by you, obtained from
        third parties, and/or created by us when you use the Services.</p>
      <p><strong>Customer Content.</strong> Customers routinely
        submit Customer Content to {{ settingsFile().appName }} when using the Services.</p>
      <p><strong>Services Data.</strong> {{
        settingsFile().appName }} also collects,
        generates and/or receives the following types of Personal Data, other than Customer Content, through and in
        connection with {{ settingsFile().appName }}’s provision of the Services (the “Services Data”):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Organization and account information.
            </strong>To create or update an Organization account, you or the relevant Customer (e.g. you or your
            employer) will supply {{ settingsFile().appName }} with an email address, phone number, password, domain
            and/or similar account
            details. We may also receive your email address and name from Slack or other organizations with whom our
            platform has integrations through which you may sign up to use our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Billing information.</strong> Customers
            that
            purchase a paid version of the Services may provide {{ settingsFile().appName }} (or its payment
            processors)
            with billing details
            such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Service metadata. </strong>When a User
            interacts with the Services, metadata is generated to provide additional context about their use of the
            Services. For example, {{ settingsFile().appName }} logs the Organizations, boards, people, features,
            content and links that you
            view or interact with, as well the types of files shared and any Third-Party Services that you use.</p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Device data.</strong> {{

            information about devices accessing the Services, including the type of device, operating system used,
            device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all
            of this Services Data often depends on the type of device used and its settings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Location data.</strong> We receive
            information from you, the relevant Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your
            location.
            We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer or an IP address received from your
            browser or device to determine approximate location. {{ settingsFile().appName }} may also collect
            location
            information from devices
            in accordance with the consent provided by your device.</p>
        </li>

        or
        business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an
        “authorized agent”), may make the requests set forth above. You may also make a request on behalf of your
        minor
        child. The request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail
        that
        allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. In addition, you should provide adequate
        information that we can reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal
        information (including information that enables us to verify the identifying information we possibly maintain
        about you).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably
        timely manner. If we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in
        writing. In order to protect the security of your Personal Data, we will not honor a request if we cannot
        verify
        your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. The method used
        to
        verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity and value of the information, including the risk of
        harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion. Generally speaking, verification will be performed by
        matching the identifying information provided by you to the Personal Data that we already have.</p>
      <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the
        12-month
        period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period). If
        we
        cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain
        the reasons we cannot comply.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Non-Discrimination.&nbsp;</strong>We will not
        discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights based on California data protection laws,
        including,
        but not limited to, by:&nbsp;</p>
