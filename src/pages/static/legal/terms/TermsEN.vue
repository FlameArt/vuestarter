      Such additional uses by {{ info.appName }} and other users of the Service is made without compensation to you or
      any other provider of the Submissions with respect to the Content, as the use of the Service by you is hereby
      agreed as being sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein. Furthermore, and for the

    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service , if you are a user who has subscribed to the paid tier of
      the Service, {{ info.appName }} hereby assigns to you all of its right, title and interest in and to any Output
      owned by {{ info.appName }} and generated from Submissions made by you through the Service during the term of your

    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Output may be publicly available in a third party application such as Discord, where
      it may be viewable, downloadable, and modified by other users of that third party application. If the Output
      becomes publicly available in such third-party application, you agree that other users have a right to access,
      display, view, store, modify, and copy such Output; provided, however, that you may change your settings to bypass
      these public sharing default settings so that Output generated will remain private.</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Service may generate the
      same or similar output for a third party. Other users may provide similar submissions and receive the same output.
      Output that is requested by and generated for other users is not your Content.</p>
    <p>You hereby authorize {{ info.appName }} and its third-party service providers to derive statistical and usage
      data relating to your use of the Service (&quot;Usage Data&quot;). We may use Usage Data for any purpose in

    <p>Any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback, reviews, or other information about the Service

      respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or

    <p><strong>Copyright Complaints:</strong> </p>

      infringements created by the Service as a result of processing their Submission and the Client receiving the
      Output. The Client agrees to review the Output for such infringements before publication and to promptly remove
      such Output from their Platforms if necessary. {{ info.appName }} assumes no responsibility for the consequences
      of publishing any Output.</p>
    <p>{{ info.appName }} respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you
      believe that your work has been copied on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that
      your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify {{ info.appName }} of your
      infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.</p>
    <p>{{ info.appName }} will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions
      under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) and other applicable intellectual property laws with
      respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed
      to {{ info.appName }}&#39;s Copyright Agent at {{ info.DMCAContactEmail }} (Subject line: &quot;DMCA Takedown
      Request&quot;).</p>
    <p>To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or
        other intellectual property interest that is allegedly infringed;</li>
      <li>identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or,
        if multiple copyrighted works or other intellectual property are covered by a single notification, a
        representative list of such works or other intellectual property;</li>
      <li>identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity,
        and where the content that you claim is infringing is located on the Service, with enough detail that we may
        find it on the Service;</li>
      <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
      <li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright
        or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and a statement by you that the information in your
        notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or
        are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of the copyright or intellectual property that is allegedly
        infringed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Counter-Notice:</strong> If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was
      disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright
      owner&#39;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in Content, you may send a written
      counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
      <li>identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at
        which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
      <li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was
        removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content to be removed or disabled; and
      </li>
      <li>your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of
        the federal court located within Massachusetts and a statement that you will accept service of process from the
        person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, {{ info.appName }} will send a copy of the counter-notice
      to the original complaining party informing them that {{ info.appName }} may replace the removed content or cease
      disabling it within ten (10) business days. Unless the owner of the applicable copyrighted work or other
      intellectual property files an action seeking a court order against {{ info.appName }} or the user, the removed
      content may be replaced, or access to it restored, within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after
      receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>Repeat Infringer Policy:</strong> In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, {{ info.appName
      }} has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at {{ info.appName }}&#39;s sole
      discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. {{ info.appName }} may also at its sole

      property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>All disputes arising from the Terms of Use, its appendices, instructions, including those related to its
        performance, breach, termination, or invalidity, shall be submitted to the Economic Court of Minsk, Republic of
        Belarus. The pre-trial claim procedure is mandatory. The response time to a claim is set at 10 (ten) working

    <p>YOU AND {{ info.appName.toUpperCase() }} AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN
      INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR

      <li>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</li>
    </ol>
    <p>{{ info.appName }} is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer
      concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer&#39;s satisfaction by emailing customer support at
      {{ info.SupportEmail }}. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first
      send
      to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to {{ info.appName
      }} should be sent to {{ info.OrganizationMailAdress }} and must be additionally sent to the email
      {{ info.LegalContactEmail }} (address and email collectively &quot;Notice Address&quot;). The Notice must (i)
      describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If {{
        info.appName }} and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you
      or {{ info.appName }} may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
      offer made by {{ info.appName }} or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
      determines the amount, if any, to which you or {{ info.appName }} is entitled.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Costs of Arbitration</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the &quot;Arbitration Fees&quot;) will

      extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either {{ info.appName }} or you under the Economic
      Court of Minsk Rules, {{ info.appName }} and you shall and you must pay them in full. Any payment of
      attorneys&#39; fees will be governed by the Economic Court of Minsk Rules.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Severability</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the
      subsection (b) above titled &quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
      Relief&quot; above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term
      or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
      unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or
      the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled &quot;Prohibition of Class and
      Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot; are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
      Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable
      solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue
      to apply.</p>

      to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
      above, you and {{ info.appName }} submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
      courts located within Massachusetts. The failure of {{ info.appName }} to exercise or enforce any right or
      provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
      these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
      that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#39; intentions as reflected in the provision, and
      the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any
      statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or
      these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
      barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible
      in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and
      subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
      printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of {{ info.appName }},
      but {{ info.appName }} may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.
      The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As
      used in these Terms of Service, the words &quot;include&quot; and &quot;including,&quot; and variations thereof,
